## General Search Tools

These are the most commonly used tools for broad searches across all content types.

### search_sdk

**Purpose**: Intelligent multi-modal search with AI intent mapping

**Best for**:
- General questions about SDK features
- Conceptual queries ("how do I...")
- When you don't know the exact API name

**How it works**:
- Uses AI to understand your intent
- Expands queries with technical synonyms
- Searches across all content types

**Example queries**:
- "How do I connect to a camera?"
- "What APIs control focus?"
- "Show me how to start live view"

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Understands natural language
- ✅ Finds relevant results even with vague queries
- ✅ Good for exploratory searches

**Limitations**:
- ⚠️ Slower than other tools (AI processing time)
- ⚠️ May timeout on very complex queries

---

### search_hybrid

**Purpose**: Combined semantic and exact match search

**Best for**:
- Balanced search when you have some keywords
- Finding specific features with context
- When semantic search alone isn't precise enough

**How it works**:
- Combines vector similarity search with metadata filtering
- Faster than search_sdk (no AI intent mapping)
- Returns results ranked by relevance

**Example queries**:
- "SetSaveInfo parameters"
- "camera compatibility for focus position"
- "error code 0x80010001"

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Faster than search_sdk
- ✅ More precise than pure semantic search
- ✅ Good balance of speed and accuracy

**Limitations**:
- ⚠️ Less flexible with natural language

---

### search_with_intent_analysis

**Purpose**: Advanced query expansion for complex questions

**Best for**:
- Multi-part questions
- Complex technical queries
- When simple search doesn't return good results

**How it works**:
- Deep AI analysis of query intent
- Generates multiple search variations
- Aggregates and ranks results

**Example queries**:
- "What's the difference between V1.14 and V2.00 connection APIs?"
- "How do I handle errors when camera disconnects during capture?"

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Best for complex queries
- ✅ Most intelligent interpretation

**Limitations**:
- ⚠️ Slowest tool (deep AI processing)
- ⚠️ Higher chance of timeout
- ⚠️ May return too many results

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Start Broad, Then Narrow**
  1. Begin with `search_sdk` for general questions
  2. If results aren't precise enough, try `search_hybrid`
  3. For exact matches, use `search_exact_api`
</Tip>

<Warning>
  **Known Limitations**
  - Intent mapping can timeout on very complex queries
  - Not all camera models may be in compatibility tables
  - Code examples are limited to what's in the SDK samples
</Warning>

## Need Help?

If you're not getting good results:

1. **Try a different approach** - Rephrase your question with more context
2. **Be specific** - Include API names, camera models, or error codes when known
3. **Check your SDK version** - Make sure you're searching the right version
4. **Ask your AI assistant** - It can help refine your query

The AI assistant will automatically choose the best tool, but understanding what's available helps you ask better questions!
