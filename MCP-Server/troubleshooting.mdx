While we've taken steps to ensure the smoothest experience possible using the AI SDK Assistant, you may encounter the following issues in the beta release.

## Could not connect to MCP Server [server name]

**Most likely issue:** Connection to the server timed out.

**Solutions:**
- Check to make sure your configuration aligns with the setup instructions
- Stop generating the current response, refresh the page and try again
- Disconnect and reconnect to the MCP server
- If neither of these work, delete the server and add it again
- If still doesn't work, contact jordan.lee@sony.com and fill out a bug report

## Tool [tool name] not found

**Most likely issue:** Connection to the server was lost. Tools not available for use.

**Solutions:**
- Disconnect and reconnect to the server
- If this doesn't work, delete the server and add it again

## Claude's response was interrupted. This can be caused by network problems or exceeding the maximum conversation length

**Most likely issue:** Connection to the server is successful, but connection was temporarily lost due to startup not complete.

**Solutions:**
- Refresh the page, wait 30 seconds before making a query to the AI SDK Assistant
- Make your first request smaller. After successful response, resume normal operation

## Tool call [i.e. Search hybrid] returns no results or 429 error

**Most likely issue:** Rate limit exceeded (20 requests/second or 100 requests/minute)

**Solutions:**
- Wait several seconds before making another request
- If your LLM is making rapid consecutive requests, prompt it to space out tool calls
- If the tool call body has a top_k (number of content to retrieve), exceeding >5, prompt it to keep top_k<5
  ```json
  {
    "query": "exposure compensation",
    "top_k": 1
  }
  ```
