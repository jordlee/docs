### What is Kando?

Kando is an intellegent search engine that allows LLMs (large language models) to access complete API documentation, code examples, and system design recommendations for Sony's developer products, starting with the Camera Remote SDK. 

We built this tool to address a common struggle faced by developers and technologists: 

> "**Learning a new SDK sucks. **It's time consuming and frustrating to sift through hundreds of pages of API reference, thousands of lines of sample code, and understand how it fits together with the solution I'm building."

<Card title="Our Message to Developers" icon="message">
  By leveraging the reasoning, search, and coding capabilities of today's top LLMs from Anthropic, OpenAI, and open-source providers, we've made it possible to turn your preferred AI agents into experts on Sony's SDKs so you can build faster and focus on creating value for your customers.

### How does it work?

Kando uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to give LLMs access to complete SDK documentation, code examples, and system design recommendations.

MCP is a new framework pioneered by Anthropic (creator's of Claude and top-performing LLMs like Opus and Sonnet) which has been gaining traction since its announcement in September 2024, but is still in its early beta testing stages.

### Code Block

Use [fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) by enclosing code in three backticks and follow the leading ticks with the programming language of your snippet to get syntax highlighting. Optionally, you can also write the name of your code after the programming language.

```java HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
