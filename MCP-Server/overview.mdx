## What is Sony's AI SDK Assistant?

The AI SDK Assistant is an intelligent search assistant that helps developers learn and use Sony's Camera Remote SDK faster. Instead of manually searching through hundreds of pages of documentation, you can ask questions in plain English to AI assistants like Claude or ChatGPT, and get instant answers with code examples.

We built this tool to solve a common problem:

> "**Learning a new SDK is hard.** It takes hours to find the right API, understand how it works, and figure out how to use it in your project."

  Turn your favorite AI assistant into an SDK expert that can answer questions, explain APIs, provide code examples, and help you build faster.

## How It Works

Our AI SDK Assistant works in three simple steps:

**1. You Ask a Question**

- Ask your AI assistant (Claude or ChatGPT) about the Camera Remote SDK
- Examples: "How do I connect to a camera?" or "Show me how to capture an image in C#"

**2. AI SDK Assistant Searches for Answers**

- The AI assistant automatically uses AI SDK Assistant to search through SDK documentation
- Searches across 8,962+ pieces of content including guides, API references, and code examples
- Works with both SDK V1.14.00 and V2.00.00

**3. You Get Instant Results**

- Receive relevant documentation, function details, and working code examples
- All formatted and explained by your AI assistant
- No need to leave your conversation

## What Makes This Tool Different?

### Smart Search

The AI SDK Assistant understands what you're asking for, even if you don't know the exact API name. It uses AI to interpret your question and find the most relevant answers.

### Multiple Content Types

- ðŸ“– **Documentation**: Tutorials, guides, and explanations
- ðŸ”§ **API References**: Function definitions and parameters
- ðŸ’» **Code Examples**: Working C++ and C# code
- ðŸ“Š **Compatibility Tables**: Which cameras support which features

### Version Support

Switch between SDK versions (V1.14.00 and V2.00.00) to find information for the version you're using.

### Use With Your Preferred AI Tool

Works with Claude (web, mobile, desktop), ChatGPT, and other AI assistants that support MCP (Model Context Protocol).

## The Technology (Simplified)

**For those curious about what's under the hood:**

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Combines AI understanding with database search to find accurate answers
- **Vector Embeddings**: Converts documentation into a format AI can search semantically
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: The standard that lets AI assistants connect to AI SDK Assistant
- **Cloud Hosted**: Runs on Railway for reliable 24/7 availability

You don't need to understand these technologies to use the AI SDK Assistantâ€”just connect it to your AI assistant and start asking questions!
