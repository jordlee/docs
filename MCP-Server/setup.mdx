The Kando MCP server is compatible with Claude (web, mobile, desktop, and CLI), ChatGPT (web), and LM Studio (open-source desktop). These platforms use what are colloquially termed "connectors" to access MCP servers directly from the existing UI.

<Note>
  You'll need the official MCP server URL to use Kando with your LLM provider. Please fill out the form to gain access to the URL.

### Enabling Tools

Kando enables Claude to access SDK information through "Tools." These are specialized search methods and filters that influence what type of content is retreived when you ask a question.

There are currently 14 tools supported for Claude; you can view more details about each tool in the page.

<Tip>
  Claude will automatically determine the best tool to answer the query, though you can always specify a tool if you already know what type of content you are looking for.
</Tip>

To view the Kando's available tools:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Connectors**.
2. Next to the Kando connector, click the **Configure **button.
3. You'll now be able to see all available tools Kando offers.

By default, all tools will be **enabled**. 

There are two tools that you must disable when using Kando with Claude. 

<Warning>
  Disable the**search ** and **fetch **tools before prompting with Kando. These tools are intended for use only with ChatGPT.
</Warning>

The default tool permission setting is **always ask for permission**. 

In this configuration, Claude will ask for permission every time it wants to use a tool. To allow automatic tool usage, set the permission to **allow unsupervised. **

<Tip>
  When using Kando for the first time, we recommend you set all tool permissions to **allow unsupervised**. 

  This will help you understand the strengths and weaknesses of each tool for your specific topics of interest. Based on your observations, you can disable tools and change permissions to help Claude's searches align with your preferences.
