The Kando MCP server is compatible with Claude (web, mobile, desktop, and CLI), ChatGPT (web), and LM Studio (open-source desktop). These platforms use what are colloquially termed "connectors" to access MCP servers directly from the existing UI.

You'll need the official MCP server URL to use Kando with your LLM provider. Please fill out the form to gain access to the URL.

### Enabling Tools

Kando enables Claude to access SDK information through "Tools." These are specialized search methods and filters that influence what type of content is retreived when you ask a question.

There are currently 14 tools supported for Claude; you can view more details about each tool in the **Tools **page. 

<Info>
  Claude will automatically determine the best tool to answer the query, though you can always specify a tool if you already know what type of content you are looking for.
