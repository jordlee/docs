The AI SDK Assistant MCP server is compatible with Claude (web, mobile, desktop, and CLI), and ChatGPT (web). These platforms use what are colloquially termed "connectors" to access MCP servers directly from the existing UI.

<Note>
  You'll need the official MCP server URL to use AI SDK Assistant with your LLM provider. Since the tool is still in Private Beta, please do not share this URL with others.
</Note>

    ### Requirements

    - Claude Pro, Max, or Enterprise account (starting at \$20/month)
    - MCP Server URL: `https://sdk-rag-agent-production.up.railway.app/mcp`

    ### Configuration Steps

    1. **Add the Connector**
       - Go to **Settings → Connectors**
       - Click **Add custom connector**
       - Name it (e.g. `AI SDK Assistant`)
       - Paste the MCP Server URL into the "Remote MCP server URL" field
       - Click **Add**
       - Refresh if needed — you should now see your new connector
    2. **Configure Tools**

       The AI SDK Assistant enables Claude to access SDK information through "Tools." These are specialized search methods and filters that influence what type of content is retrieved when you ask a question.

       There are currently 14 tools supported for Claude; you can view more details about each tool in the [Tools](/MCP-Server/tools) page.

       <Tip>
         Claude will automatically determine the best tool to answer the query, though you can always specify a tool if you already know what type of content you are looking for.
       </Tip>
       To configure AI SDK Assistant's tools:
       - Navigate to **Settings → Connectors**
       - Next to the AI SDK Assistant connector, click the **Configure** button
       - You'll now be able to see all available tools AI SDK Assistant offers

       By default, all tools will be **enabled**.

       <Warning>
         Disable the **search** and **fetch** tools before prompting with AI SDK Assistant. These tools are intended for use only with ChatGPT.
       </Warning>
    3. **Set Tool Permissions**

       The default tool permission setting is **always ask for permission**.

       In this configuration, Claude will ask for permission every time it wants to use a tool. To allow automatic tool usage, set the permission to **allow unsupervised**.

       <Tip>
         When using AI SDK Assistant for the first time, we recommend you set all tool permissions to **allow unsupervised**. Based on your observations, you can disable tools and change permissions to help Claude's searches align better with your preferences.
       </Tip>
    4. **Configure System Prompt (Optional but Recommended)**

       A system prompt significantly improves Claude's SDK Assistant performance. See the [System Prompt Configuration](#system-prompt-configuration) section below for setup instructions. 

       <Tip>
         For the best experience with AI SDK Assistant, add the system prompt after initial testing. It ensures Claude uses MCP tools correctly and generates production-ready code.
       </Tip>

    ### Configuration Scopes

    Claude Code supports three configuration scopes for MCP servers:

    #### User Scope (Global)

    Available across all projects on your machine. Best for personal utility servers and frequently-used services.

    ```bash
    claude mcp add AI SDK Assistant --scope user npx mcp-remote https://sdk-rag-agent-production.up.railway.app/mcp
    ```

    **Configuration stored in:** `~/.claude.json`

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "AI SDK Assistant": {
          "type": "stdio",
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "mcp-remote",
            "https://sdk-rag-agent-production.up.railway.app/mcp"
          ],
          "env": {}
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    #### Project Scope (Team Shared)

    Shared with all team members via `.mcp.json` in the project root. Best for team collaboration.

    ```bash
    claude mcp add AI SDK Assistant --scope project npx mcp-remote https://sdk-rag-agent-production.up.railway.app/mcp
    ```

    **Configuration stored in:** `.mcp.json` (project root)

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "AI SDK Assistant": {
          "type": "stdio",
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "mcp-remote",
            "https://sdk-rag-agent-production.up.railway.app/mcp"
          ],
          "env": {}
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    <Tip>
      Commit `.mcp.json` to version control to share MCP server configuration with your team.
    </Tip>
    #### Local Scope (Private)

    Private to current user and project only. Best for personal development servers or experimental configurations.

    ```bash
    claude mcp add AI SDK Assistant npx mcp-remote https://sdk-rag-agent-production.up.railway.app/mcp
    ```

    **Configuration stored in:** `~/.claude.json` (project-specific section)

    ### Scope Priority

    When multiple scopes define the same server, Claude Code uses this priority order: **Local \> Project \> User**

    ### Verification

    After adding the MCP server, verify it's connected:

    ```bash
    claude mcp list
    ```

    You should see:

    ```
    AI SDK Assistant: npx mcp-remote https://sdk-rag-agent-production.up.railway.app/mcp - ✓ Connected
    ```

    ### Managing MCP Servers

    **List all servers:**

    ```bash
    claude mcp list
    ```

    **Remove a server:**

    ```bash
    claude mcp remove AI SDK Assistant --scope user    # Remove from user scope
    claude mcp remove AI SDK Assistant --scope project # Remove from project scope
    claude mcp remove AI SDK Assistant                 # Remove from local scope
    ```

    <Note>
      Restart Claude Code or start a new session after modifying MCP server configurations.
    </Note>
    ### **Configure System Prompt with Subagents (Optional but Recommended)**

    Claude Code supports creating specialized subagents with custom system prompts. This is ideal for SDK-focused development work.

    **Why use a subagent?**

    - Maintains SDK-specific context across sessions
    - Can run tasks in parallel with the main agent
    - Persistent configuration per project or globally

    See the [System Prompt Configuration](#system-prompt-configuration) section below for detailed instructions on creating a subagent with the AI SDK Assistant system prompt.

    <Note>
      For simple queries, use AI SDK Assistant with your main agent. For complex SDK development, create a dedicated subagent with the system prompt.
    </Note>
    ### Tool Permissions

    Claude Code supports **granular tool-level permissions** configured through settings files. You can approve all tools from a server or specific individual tools.

    **Approve all tools from the AI SDK Assistant server:**

    ```json
    "approvedTools": ["mcp__CRSDK"]
    ```

    **Approve specific tools only:**

    ```json
    "approvedTools": [
      "mcp__CRSDK__search_sdk",
      "mcp__CRSDK__search_code_examples",
      "mcp__CRSDK__search_documentation",
      "mcp__CRSDK__search_api_functions",
      "mcp__CRSDK__search_compatibility"
    ]
    ```

    <Note>
      - **`Wildcards (*) are not supported`** for MCP permissions
      - You must explicitly list each tool or approve the entire server
      - See [Claude Code IAM Documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/iam#access-control-and-permissions) for detailed permission configuration
    </Note>
    **Configuration scopes:**

    - **User scope**: Global across all projects (`~/.claude.json`)
    - **Project scope**: Per-project configuration (`.claude/config.json`)
    - **Local scope**: Repository-specific (`.claude.local.json`)

    **What's different from Claude web:**

    - ❌ No visual UI for tool management
    - ✅ File-based configuration (version control friendly)
    - ✅ Granular tool-level permissions via settings files
    - ✅ Multiple configuration scopes (user, project, local)
