Kando uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to give LLMs access to complete SDK documentation, code examples, and system design recommendations. 

MCP is a new framework pioneered by Anthropic (creator's of Claude and top-performing LLMs like Opus and Sonnet) which has been gaining traction since its announcement in September 2024, but is still in its early beta testing stages. 

The Kando MCP server is compatible with Claude (web, mobile, desktop, and CLI), ChatGPT (web), and LM Studio (open-source desktop). These platforms use what are colloquially termed "connectors" to access MCP servers directly from the existing UI. 

You'll need the official MCP server URL to use Kando with your LLM provider. Please fill out the form to gain access to the URL.

    ### Requirements

    To use Kando with Claude in the web browser or mobile app, you'll need the following:

    1. Claude Pro, Max, or Enterprise account (starting at \$20/month)
    2. MCP Server URL
    3. System Prompt

    ### Configuration Instructions

    1. Navigate to "Settings" in the left panel.
    2. Click on the "Connectors" tab to configure a new connector.
    3. Press the "Add custom connector" button.
    4. Give your connector a name (e.g. Kando).
    5. Paste in the MCP Server URL in the "Remote MCP server URL" field. Please fill out this form to request access.
    6. Click the "Add" button to finish the connector configuration.
    7. If the connection is successful, you should see a new connector with the {connector name} from step 4. You may need to refresh the page for the UI to update.

## Navigation syntax

Our navigation syntax is recursive which means you can make nested navigation groups. You don't need to include `.mdx` in page names.

<CodeGroup>

```json Regular Navigation
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "Docs",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Getting Started",
          "pages": ["quickstart"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```


```json Nested Navigation
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "Docs",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Getting Started",
          "pages": [
            "quickstart",
            {
              "group": "Nested Reference Pages",
              "pages": ["nested-reference-page"]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Folders

Simply put your MDX files in folders and update the paths in `docs.json`.

For example, to have a page at `https://yoursite.com/your-folder/your-page` you would make a folder called `your-folder` containing an MDX file called `your-page.mdx`.

<Warning>
  You cannot use `api` for the name of a folder unless you nest it inside another folder. Mintlify uses Next.js which reserves the top-level `api` folder for internal server calls. A folder name such as `api-reference` would be accepted.
</Warning>

```json Navigation With Folder
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "Docs",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Group Name",
          "pages": ["your-folder/your-page"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Hidden Pages

MDX files not included in `docs.json` will not show up in the sidebar but are accessible through the search bar and by linking directly to them.
