Kando uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to give LLMs access to complete SDK documentation, code examples, and system design recommendations.

MCP is a new framework pioneered by Anthropic (creator's of Claude and top-performing LLMs like Opus and Sonnet) which has been gaining traction since its announcement in September 2024, but is still in its early beta testing stages.

The Kando MCP server is compatible with Claude (web, mobile, desktop, and CLI), ChatGPT (web), and LM Studio (open-source desktop). These platforms use what are colloquially termed "connectors" to access MCP servers directly from the existing UI.

You'll need the official MCP server URL to use Kando with your LLM provider. Please fill out the form to gain access to the URL.
