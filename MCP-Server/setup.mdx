The Kando MCP server is compatible with Claude (web, mobile, desktop, and CLI), ChatGPT (web), and LM Studio (open-source desktop). These platforms use what are colloquially termed "connectors" to access MCP servers directly from the existing UI.

<Note>
  You'll need the official MCP server URL to use Kando with your LLM provider. Since the tool is still in Private Beta, please do not share this URL with others.

    ### Requirements

    - Claude Pro, Max, or Enterprise account (starting at \$20/month)
    - MCP Server URL
    - System Prompt

    ### Basic Setup

    1. Go to **Settings → Connectors**.
    2. Click **Add custom connector**.
    3. Name it (e.g. `Kando`).
    4. Paste the MCP Server URL into the "Remote MCP server URL" field.
    5. Click **Add**.
    6. Refresh if needed — you should now see your new connector.

    ### Enabling Tools

    Kando enables Claude to access SDK information through "Tools." These are specialized search methods and filters that influence what type of content is retreived when you ask a question.

    There are currently 14 tools supported for Claude; you can view more details about each tool in the page.

    <Tip>
      Claude will automatically determine the best tool to answer the query, though you can always specify a tool if you already know what type of content you are looking for.
    </Tip>
    To view the Kando's available tools:

    1. Navigate to **Settings → Connectors**.
    2. Next to the Kando connector, click the \*\*Configure \*\*button.
    3. You'll now be able to see all available tools Kando offers.

    By default, all tools will be **enabled**.

    There are two tools that you must disable when using Kando with Claude.

    <Warning>
      Disable the\*\*search \*\* and \*\*fetch \*\*tools before prompting with Kando. These tools are intended for use only with ChatGPT.
    </Warning>
    The default tool permission setting is **always ask for permission**.

    In this configuration, Claude will ask for permission every time it wants to use a tool. To allow automatic tool usage, set the permission to \*\*allow unsupervised. \*\*

    <Tip>
      When using Kando for the first time, we recommend you set all tool permissions to **allow unsupervised**. Based on your observations, you can disable tools and change permissions to help Claude's searches align better with your preferences.
    </Tip>
    ### Using Tools

    To start using Kando's tools, open a new chat window.

    Click the \*\*search and tools \*\*icon button in the chat box. You should now see the Kando connector at the top of the list.

    You can toggle the connector on and off, as well as toggle individual tools directly in the chat window.

    ### Deleting Kando

    If you decide you no longer want to keep Kando as a connector, or want to temporarily disconnect from it, here's how:

    1. Go to **Settings → Connectors**.
    2. Click the \*\*More \*\*icon button next to the Kando connector.
    3. Click **Remove** to permanantely remove the connector (you'll need to start the entire process if you want to add Kando at a later time).
    4. Click \*\*Disconnect \*\* to temporarily remove the connector.

    ### Requirements

    - Claude Code CLI installed
    - MCP Server URL
    - System Prompt

    ### Configuration Scopes

    Claude Code supports three configuration scopes for MCP servers:

    #### User Scope (Global)

    Available across all projects on your machine. Best for personal utility servers and frequently-used services.

    ```bash
    claude mcp add Kando --scope user npx mcp-remote https://sdk-rag-agent-production.up.railway.app/mcp
    ```

    **Configuration stored in:** `~/.claude.json`

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "Kando": {
          "type": "stdio",
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "mcp-remote",
            "https://sdk-rag-agent-production.up.railway.app/mcp"
          ],
          "env": {}
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    #### Project Scope (Team Shared)

    Shared with all team members via `.mcp.json` in the project root. Best for team collaboration.

    ```bash
    claude mcp add Kando --scope project npx mcp-remote https://sdk-rag-agent-production.up.railway.app/mcp
    ```

    **Configuration stored in:** `.mcp.json` (project root)

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "Kando": {
          "type": "stdio",
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "mcp-remote",
            "https://sdk-rag-agent-production.up.railway.app/mcp"
          ],
          "env": {}
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    <Tip>
      Commit `.mcp.json` to version control to share MCP server configuration with your team.
    </Tip>
    #### Local Scope (Private)

    Private to current user and project only. Best for personal development servers or experimental configurations.

    ```bash
    claude mcp add Kando npx mcp-remote https://sdk-rag-agent-production.up.railway.app/mcp
    ```

    **Configuration stored in:** `~/.claude.json` (project-specific section)

    ### Scope Priority

    When multiple scopes define the same server, Claude Code uses this priority order: **Local \> Project \> User**

    ### Verification

    After adding the MCP server, verify it's connected:

    ```bash
    claude mcp list
    ```

    You should see:

    ```
    Kando: npx mcp-remote https://sdk-rag-agent-production.up.railway.app/mcp - ✓ Connected
    ```

    ### Managing MCP Servers

    **List all servers:**

    ```bash
    claude mcp list
    ```

    **Remove a server:**

    ```bash
    claude mcp remove Kando --scope user    # Remove from user scope
    claude mcp remove Kando --scope project # Remove from project scope
    claude mcp remove Kando                 # Remove from local scope
    ```

    <Note>
      Restart Claude Code or start a new session after modifying MCP server configurations.
