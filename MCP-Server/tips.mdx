## General Prompting Tips

Get better results from Kando by following these best practices when asking questions about the Camera Remote SDK.

### Be Specific with Context

<Tip>
  **Include relevant details** in your questions to get more accurate answers:
  - **Camera model** (e.g., "ILX-LR1", "ILCE-7M4", "A7 IV")
  - **SDK version** (V1.14.00 or V2.00.00)
  - **Programming language** (C++ or C#)
  - **Connection type** (USB, wired LAN, wireless LAN)
  - **Operating system** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
  - **Connection mode** (RemoteControlMode, ContentsTransferMode, RemoteTransferMode)
</Tip>

**Example:**
- ‚ùå Vague: "How do I connect to a camera?"
- ‚úÖ Specific: "How do I connect to an ILX-LR1 camera via wired LAN using the C++ SDK V2.00.00 on Windows in RemoteControlMode?"

### Use Exact Terminology When Known

If you already know specific API names, error codes, or property codes, include them in your query for faster, more precise results.

**Examples:**
- "What parameters does `SetSaveInfo` accept?"
- "What causes error code `CrError_Connect_TimeOut`?"
- "How do I use `CrDeviceProperty_FNumber` to set aperture?"

### Ask for Code Examples

Kando has access to working C++ and C# code examples from the SDK. Don't hesitate to request them.

**Example prompts:**
- "Show me C++ code to capture an image and save it to the host"
- "Give me a C# example of connecting to a camera with SSH authentication"
- "What's the code for setting ISO sensitivity in C++?"

### Request Compatibility Information

Check which cameras support specific features before implementation.

**Example prompts:**
- "Which cameras support RemoteTransferMode?"
- "Does the ILX-LR1 support wireless LAN connection?"
- "What connection modes are available for the ILCE-1?"

### Iterate and Follow Up

If the first answer isn't quite right, ask follow-up questions or rephrase with more details.

**Example:**
1. Initial: "How do I set camera properties?"
2. Follow-up: "How do I set F-stop specifically? Do I need to check if it's writable first?"
3. Clarification: "Show me the complete code including error handling"

## When and How to Use Kando

### Automatic Tool Selection

Kando uses **13+ specialized search tools** to find the best answers for your questions. Your AI assistant automatically chooses the right tool based on what you're asking.

<Note>
  You don't need to specify which tool to use‚Äîjust ask your question naturally. Kando's AI will determine whether to search documentation, code examples, API references, compatibility tables, or error codes.
</Note>

### Available Search Capabilities

Kando can search across:

- üìñ **Documentation**: Tutorials, guides, workflows, and conceptual explanations
- üîß **API Functions**: Function signatures, parameters, return types
- üíª **Code Examples**: Working C++ and C# implementations
- üìä **Compatibility Tables**: Camera models, features, connection types
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Error & Warning Codes**: Detailed error explanations and solutions

For detailed information about each search tool, see the [Tools](/MCP-Server/tools) page.

### SDK Version Switching

Kando currently searches **SDK V2.00.00** by default. If you need information from V1.14.00, just specify it in your question.

**Example:**
- "In SDK V1.14.00, how do I initialize the SDK?"
- "What's the difference between V1.14.00 and V2.00.00 for camera connection?"

Your AI assistant can use the `set_sdk_version` tool to switch versions during the conversation if needed.

### When Kando Searches Automatically

Your AI assistant will automatically use Kando when you ask questions about:

- Camera Remote SDK features and capabilities
- How to implement specific SDK operations
- API function usage and parameters
- Debugging errors or understanding warnings
- Camera compatibility and requirements
- SDK code examples and patterns

<Warning>
  **For Claude Code users**: Unlike Claude web, Claude Code does not support granular tool permissions. All Kando tools are available once the MCP server is added. The only control is the initial approval when using project-scoped servers.
</Warning>

    *Compatibility:*
    > *"ILX-LR1 must be used with SSH authentication. Use a USB Type C wired LAN adaptor. One camera can be controlled by multiple host PCs. The maximum number of simultaneous connections is 5 users (applications)."*

    *Pairing workflow:*
    > *"When connecting via wired LAN, you need to perform the 'Network > Cnct./Remote Sht. > Remote Shoot Function > Pairing' operation on the camera to make it memorize the host PC. Once the pairing is established, turn off the camera, pause for about 10 seconds, and then turn it back on again."*

  <Accordion title="Performance Validation" icon="gauge-high">
    **Prompt:**
    ```
    My application needs to capture images every [X] seconds for [Y] hours.

    Are there any SDK limitations I should be aware of?
    How can I validate that my implementation meets these requirements?
    ```

    **What Kando Returns:**
    - Timing considerations and limitations
    - Resource management best practices
    - Long-running operation guidance
    - Performance monitoring approaches

    **Example Response Snippet:**
    > *"The camera may not accept shooting operations immediately after connection. Wait for proper callback notifications before sending commands."*

    **Use when**: Validating performance requirements
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Multi-Camera Testing" icon="camera-retro">
    **Prompt:**
    ```
    I need to test controlling [number] cameras simultaneously.

    What's the recommended testing approach? What are common pitfalls
    when managing multiple camera connections?
    ```

    **What Kando Returns:**
    - Connection limits per camera
    - Device handle management patterns
    - Callback synchronization
    - Resource cleanup requirements

    **Example Response Snippet:**
    > *"One camera can be controlled by multiple host PCs. The maximum number of simultaneous connections is 5 users (applications). If the number of Connect requests exceeds the limit, the Connect() will fail. Note that the connection is not complete until the OnConnected() callback is received."*

    **Use when**: Testing multi-camera implementations
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cross-Platform Validation" icon="laptop">
    **Prompt:**
    ```
    My code works on [OS 1] but fails on [OS 2].

    Are there platform-specific considerations for the Camera Remote SDK?
    What should I check?
    ```

    **What Kando Returns:**
    - Platform-specific implementation details
    - String handling differences (wide char vs. char)
    - Path separator differences
    - OS-specific limitations

    **Example Response Snippet:**
    > *"Camera Remote SDK for Linux 64bit (ARMv8) and Linux 32bit (ARMv7) are not supported for wireless connections."*

    **Use when**: Validating cross-platform compatibility

## Advanced Tips

### Combining Multiple Questions

For complex workflows, you can combine multiple aspects in a single prompt:

```
I'm implementing a timelapse capture system for the ILX-LR1:

1. Design: What connection mode and APIs should I use?
2. Execution: Show me C++ code to capture every 2 seconds
3. Validation: How do I test that this will run reliably for 8 hours?

Please provide a comprehensive answer covering all three areas.
```

### Learning from Examples

Ask Kando to show you how the official sample apps implement features:

```
How does the official SDK sample application implement [feature]?
Show me the relevant code and explain the approach.
```

### Understanding API Relationships

Ask about how different APIs work together:

```
What's the relationship between SetSaveInfo, SendCommand for capture,
and the callback notifications? Walk me through the complete flow.
```
