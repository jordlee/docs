## General Prompting Tips

Get better results from Kando by following these best practices when asking questions about the Camera Remote SDK.

### Be Specific with Context

<Tip>
  **Include relevant details** in your questions to get more accurate answers:
  - **Camera model** (e.g., "ILX-LR1", "ILCE-7M4", "A7 IV")
  - **SDK version** (V1.14.00 or V2.00.00)
  - **Programming language** (C++ or C#)
  - **Connection type** (USB, wired LAN, wireless LAN)
  - **Operating system** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
  - **Connection mode** (RemoteControlMode, ContentsTransferMode, RemoteTransferMode)
</Tip>

**Example:**
- ‚ùå Vague: "How do I connect to a camera?"
- ‚úÖ Specific: "How do I connect to an ILX-LR1 camera via wired LAN using the C++ SDK V2.00.00 on Windows in RemoteControlMode?"

### Use Exact Terminology When Known

If you already know specific API names, error codes, or property codes, include them in your query for faster, more precise results.

**Examples:**
- "What parameters does `SetSaveInfo` accept?"
- "What causes error code `CrError_Connect_TimeOut`?"
- "How do I use `CrDeviceProperty_FNumber` to set aperture?"

### Ask for Code Examples

Kando has access to working C++ and C# code examples from the SDK. Don't hesitate to request them.

**Example prompts:**
- "Show me C++ code to capture an image and save it to the host"
- "Give me a C# example of connecting to a camera with SSH authentication"
- "What's the code for setting ISO sensitivity in C++?"

### Request Compatibility Information

Check which cameras support specific features before implementation.

**Example prompts:**
- "Which cameras support RemoteTransferMode?"
- "Does the ILX-LR1 support wireless LAN connection?"
- "What connection modes are available for the ILCE-1?"

### Iterate and Follow Up

If the first answer isn't quite right, ask follow-up questions or rephrase with more details.

**Example:**
1. Initial: "How do I set camera properties?"
2. Follow-up: "How do I set F-stop specifically? Do I need to check if it's writable first?"
3. Clarification: "Show me the complete code including error handling"

## When and How to Use Kando

### Automatic Tool Selection

Kando uses **13+ specialized search tools** to find the best answers for your questions. Your AI assistant automatically chooses the right tool based on what you're asking.

<Note>
  You don't need to specify which tool to use‚Äîjust ask your question naturally. Kando's AI will determine whether to search documentation, code examples, API references, compatibility tables, or error codes.
</Note>

### Available Search Capabilities

Kando can search across:

- üìñ **Documentation**: Tutorials, guides, workflows, and conceptual explanations
- üîß **API Functions**: Function signatures, parameters, return types
- üíª **Code Examples**: Working C++ and C# implementations

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Error & Warning Codes**: Detailed error explanations and solutions

For detailed information about each search tool, see the [Tools](/MCP-Server/tools) page.

### SDK Version Switching

Kando currently searches **SDK V2.00.00** by default. If you need information from V1.14.00, just specify it in your question.

**Example:**
- "In SDK V1.14.00, how do I initialize the SDK?"
- "What's the difference between V1.14.00 and V2.00.00 for camera connection?"

Your AI assistant can use the `set_sdk_version` tool to switch versions during the conversation if needed.

### When Kando Searches Automatically

Your AI assistant will automatically use Kando when you ask questions about:

- Camera Remote SDK features and capabilities
- How to implement specific SDK operations
- API function usage and parameters
- Debugging errors or understanding warnings
- Camera compatibility and requirements
- SDK code examples and patterns

<Warning>

    **Prompt:**
    ```
    I'm a developer for a drone manufacturer that builds remote control
    solar panel and cell tower inspection systems using the ILX-LR1.

    We want to:
    - Control the camera to set F-stop and other basic settings
    - Recall those settings at the start of flight
    - Save photos to the host computer only (not camera SD card)
    - Take photos every 1 second until a command is given

    Can you help me understand:
    1. Which SDK APIs and operations I'll need to use
    2. What connection type and mode is best for this use case
    3. Any special requirements for the ILX-LR1
    4. How to structure the workflow from connection to capture
    ```

    > ```
    >
    > **2. Camera Pairing (First Time):**
    > - Set camera to: Network > Cnct./Remote Sht. > Remote Shoot Function > Pairing
    > - Call `Connect()` from your app
    > - Accept pairing on camera
    > - Power cycle camera (wait 10+ seconds) to save pairing info
    >
    > **3. Configure Save Destination (Host Only):**
    > ```cpp
    > SetSaveInfo(deviceHandle, "C:\\Photos", "inspection_", 1);
    > SetDeviceProperty(CrDeviceProperty_StillImageStoreDestination,
    >                  CrStillImageStoreDestination_HostPC);
    > ```
    >
    > **4. Set Camera Properties (F-stop, ISO, etc.):**
    > ```cpp
    > GetDeviceProperties() // Check current values and available options
    > SetDeviceProperty(CrDeviceProperty_FNumber, f_28_value);
    > SetDeviceProperty(CrDeviceProperty_IsoSensitivity, iso_value);
    > // Save settings to camera memory slot for recall
    > ```
    >
    > **5. Timelapse Capture Loop (Every 1 Second):**
    > ```cpp
    > while (capture_active) {
    >     SendCommand(CrCommandId_Release, CrCommandParam_Down);
    >     Sleep(35); // ms
    >     SendCommand(CrCommandId_Release, CrCommandParam_Up);
    >     Sleep(965); // Wait remaining time for 1-second interval
    > }
    > ```
    >
    > **Recommended Connection**: Wired LAN (Ethernet) for reliable continuous operation during flight

    ```
    I need to implement [specific feature, e.g., "live view streaming"].

    What's the recommended workflow? What APIs do I need to call,
    in what order, and what are the prerequisites?
    ```

    **What Kando Returns:**
    - Complete step-by-step operation guides with API sequences
    - Timing considerations and camera state requirements
    - Prerequisites and property dependencies

    **Example Response Snippet (Live View Streaming):**
    > **Prerequisites:**
    > - Camera must be connected in RemoteControlMode
    > - Check `CrDeviceProperty_LiveViewStatus` is supported
    > - Camera may not accept operations immediately after connection‚Äîwait for `OnConnected()` callback
    >
    > **Workflow:**
    > ```
    > 1. Enable Live View:
    >    SetDeviceProperty(CrDeviceProperty_LiveView_Enable, CrLiveView_Enable)
    >
    > 2. Configure Live View Quality (optional):
    >    SetDeviceProperty(CrDeviceProperty_LiveView_Image_Quality, quality_setting)
    >
    > 3. Start Image Retrieval Loop:
    >    while (streaming) {
    >        GetLiveViewImage() // Returns JPEG image data
    >        Display image on screen
    >        Process at 30fps or camera's native rate
    >    }
    >
    > 4. Cleanup:
    >    SetDeviceProperty(CrDeviceProperty_LiveView_Enable, CrLiveView_Disable)
    > ```
    >
    > **Important Notes:**
    > - Network traffic affects stability; avoid simultaneous heavy operations
    > - Image data is retrieved from internal buffer updated by background task
    > - Camera Remote SDK does not support "Enlarge Screen" mode‚Äîdisable it on camera

    **Use when**: Implementing a specific SDK feature
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Multi-Camera Setup" icon="users">
    **Prompt:**
    ```
    I need to control multiple cameras simultaneously from one host PC.

    What are the limitations, and how should I structure my application
    to handle multiple camera connections?
    ```

    **What Kando Returns:**
    - Multi-camera connection limits and constraints
    - Architecture patterns for multi-camera control
    - Device handle management strategies
    - Callback handling for multiple cameras

    **Example Response Snippet:**
    > **Multi-Camera Limitations:**
    > - **Per Camera**: Maximum 5 simultaneous connections from different hosts/applications
    > - **Per Host PC**: No SDK-imposed limit on number of cameras (limited by system resources)
    > - **Connection Completion**: Connection isn't complete until `OnConnected()` callback is received
    > - **Exceeded Limit**: `Connect()` fails with error if camera already has 5 connections
    >
    > **Recommended Architecture:**
    > ```cpp
    > // 1. Single SDK instance manages all cameras
    > Init(); // Call once for entire application
    >
    > // 2. Enumerate all connected cameras
    > ICrEnumCameraObjectInfo* cameraList;
    > EnumCameraObjects(&cameraList);
    >
    > // 3. Store device handles in a collection
    > std::vector<CrDeviceHandle> cameras;
    > for (int i = 0; i < cameraCount; i++) {
    >     CrDeviceHandle handle;
    >     Connect(cameraInfo[i], callback, &handle, mode);
    >     cameras.push_back(handle);
    > }
    >
    > // 4. Manage each camera independently
    > for (auto handle : cameras) {
    >     GetDeviceProperties(handle, ...);
    >     SendCommand(handle, ...);
    > }
    > ```
    >
    > **Best Practices:**
    > - Use separate callback objects or camera identifiers to distinguish events from different cameras
    > - Implement thread-safe queue for handling callbacks from multiple cameras
    > - Consider network bandwidth when using multiple cameras over LAN
    > - For time-synchronized capture, account for network latency variations
    > - Properly clean up each device handle with `Disconnect()` before `Release()`

    > - USB: RemoteControl ‚úì, ContentsTransfer ‚úì
    > - Ethernet: Not supported
    >
    > **Property Feature Validation Approach:**
    >
    > To verify if specific features (F-stop, ISO, shutter speed) are supported on your camera:
    >
    > 1. **Call `GetDeviceProperties()` with property codes:**
    >    ```cpp
    >    SDK::CrDeviceProperty* prop_list = nullptr;
    >    std::int32_t nprop = 0;
    >    SDK::GetDeviceProperties(deviceHandle, &prop_list, &nprop);
    >    ```
    >
    > 2. **Check `CrPropertyEnableFlag` for each property:**
    >    - Property exists in the returned list ‚Üí Feature is supported
    >    - Property not in list ‚Üí Feature not available on this camera
    >
    > 3. **Validate writability with `IsSetEnableCurrentValue()`:**
    >    ```cpp
    >    if (prop.IsSetEnableCurrentValue()) {
    >        // Property is writable - you can set values
    >    } else {
    >        // Property is read-only or not currently settable
    >    }
    >    ```
    >
    > 4. **Example validation pattern from SDK:**
    >    ```cpp
    >    if (m_prop.f_number.writable == -1) {
    >        tout << "F-stop control is not supported on this camera\n";
    >        return false;
    >    }
    >    // Property is supported - safe to use
    >    ```
    >
    > **Important Notes:**
    > - Some properties may be read-only in certain camera modes (e.g., Auto mode)

  <Accordion title="Connection Mode Selection" icon="plug">
    **Prompt:**
    ```
    What's the difference between RemoteControlMode, ContentsTransferMode,
    and RemoteTransferMode?

    For my use case [describe], which mode should I use and why?
    ```

    **What Kando Returns:**
    - Mode descriptions and use cases
    - SDK version requirements for each mode
    - Camera support by mode
    - Performance and capability trade-offs

    **Example Response Snippet:**

    > **Connection Mode Comparison & Decision Matrix:**
    >
    > | Mode | Abbreviation | SDK Version | Capabilities | Best For |
    > |------|--------------|-------------|--------------|----------|
    > | **RemoteControlMode** | R | 1.00.00+ | Camera control + automatic transfer of newly captured images | Studio setups, live control apps, automated capture workflows |
    > | **ContentsTransferMode** | C | 1.05.00+ | Pull existing files from camera media (no control) | Backup operations, downloading existing images from SD card |
    > | **RemoteTransferMode** | T | 1.13.00+ | Combined: control + transfer new captures + pull existing media | Remote production, full file management workflows |
    >
    > **Detailed Mode Characteristics:**
    >
    > **RemoteControlMode (R):**
    > - Full camera remote control capabilities
    > - Live view image streaming available
    > - Real-time property changes (ISO, F-stop, shutter speed)
    > - Capture commands and shutter control
    > - **CAN automatically transfer newly captured images to host** (via `SetSaveInfo` + `StillImageStoreDestination`)
    > - **CANNOT pull existing images from camera SD card/media**
    > - Use when: You need control and automatic transfer of new captures, but don't need to access existing files on the card
    >
    > **ContentsTransferMode (C):**
    > - File transfer ONLY - no camera control
    > - Pull existing images from camera media slots
    > - Cannot trigger captures or change settings
    > - Requires disconnect/reconnect to switch to control mode
    > - Use when: Batch downloading existing files from camera storage (no control needed)
    >
    > **RemoteTransferMode (T):**
    > - **Full feature set**: control + automatic transfer of new captures + pull existing media files
    > - Eliminates need for mode switching (disconnect/reconnect)
    > - Can execute shooting process during content transfer
    > - Maximizes efficiency for remote production workflows
    > - **Trade-off**: Content transfer speed may decrease during simultaneous operations
    > - **Recommendation**: Measure actual performance in your environment before production use
    > - Use when: You need complete file management (new captures + existing media access) with camera control
    >
    > **Decision Tree:**
    >
    > ```
    > Do you need to control the camera?

    >                       SDK 1.13.00+ required
    > ```
    >
    > **Camera Support Notes:**
    > - Check compatibility tables - not all cameras support all modes
    > - ILX-LR1: Supports all three modes (R/C/T) on all connection types
    > - Many Alpha series cameras: Only support RemoteControlMode (R)

## Advanced Tips

### Combining Multiple Questions

For complex workflows, you can combine multiple aspects in a single prompt:

```
I'm implementing a timelapse capture system for the ILX-LR1:

1. Design: What connection mode and APIs should I use?
2. Execution: Show me C++ code to capture every 2 seconds
3. Validation: How do I test that this will run reliably for 8 hours?

Please provide a comprehensive answer covering all three areas.
```

### Learning from Examples

Ask Kando to show you how the official sample apps implement features:

```
How does the official SDK sample application implement [feature]?
Show me the relevant code and explain the approach.
