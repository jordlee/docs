## General Prompting Tips

Get better results from the AI SDK Assistant by following these best practices when asking questions about the Camera Remote SDK.

### Be Specific with Context

<Tip>
  **Include relevant details** in your questions to get more accurate answers:

  - **Camera model** (e.g., "ILX-LR1", "ILCE-7M4", "A7 IV")
  - **SDK version** (V1.14.00 or V2.00.00)
  - **Programming language** (C++ or C#)
  - **Connection type** (USB, wired LAN, wireless LAN)
  - **Operating system** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
  - **Connection mode** (RemoteControlMode, ContentsTransferMode, RemoteTransferMode)
</Tip>

**Example:**

- ‚ùå Vague: "How do I connect to a camera?"
- ‚úÖ Specific: "How do I connect to an ILX-LR1 camera via wired LAN using the C++ SDK V2.00.00 on Windows in RemoteControlMode?"

### Use Exact Terminology When Known

If you already know specific API names, error codes, or property codes, include them in your query for faster, more precise results.

**Examples:**

- "What parameters does `SetSaveInfo` accept?"
- "What causes error code `CrError_Connect_TimeOut`?"
- "How do I use `CrDeviceProperty_FNumber` to set aperture?"

### Ask for Code Examples

The AI SDK Assistant has access to working C++ and C# code examples from the SDK. Don't hesitate to request them.

**Example prompts:**

- "Show me C++ code to capture an image and save it to the host"
- "Give me a C# example of connecting to a camera with SSH authentication"
- "What's the code for setting ISO sensitivity in C++?"

### Request Compatibility Information

Check which cameras support specific features before implementation.

**Example prompts:**

- "Which cameras support RemoteTransferMode?"
- "Does the ILX-LR1 support wireless LAN connection?"
- "What connection modes are available for the ILCE-1?"

### Iterate and Follow Up

If the first answer isn't quite right, ask follow-up questions or rephrase with more details.

**Example:**

1. Initial: "How do I set camera properties?"
2. Follow-up: "How do I set F-stop specifically? Do I need to check if it's writable first?"
3. Clarification: "Show me the complete code including error handling"

## When and How to Use AI SDK Assistant

### Automatic Tool Selection

The AI SDK Assistant uses **13+ specialized search tools** to find the best answers for your questions. Your AI assistant automatically chooses the right tool based on what you're asking.

<Note>
  You don't need to specify which tool to use‚Äîjust ask your question naturally. AI SDK Assistant's AI will determine whether to search documentation, code examples, API references, compatibility tables, or error codes.
</Note>

### Available Search Capabilities

The AI SDK Assistant can search across:

- üìñ **Documentation**: Tutorials, guides, workflows, and conceptual explanations
- üîß **API Functions**: Function signatures, parameters, return types
- üíª **Code Examples**: Working C++ and C# implementations
- üìä **Compatibility Tables**: Camera models, features, connection types
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Error & Warning Codes**: Detailed error explanations and solutions

For detailed information about each search tool, see the [Tools](/MCP-Server/tools) page.

### SDK Version Switching

The AI SDK Assistant currently searches **SDK V2.00.00** by default. If you need information from V1.14.00, just specify it in your question.

**Example:**

- "In SDK V1.14.00, how do I initialize the SDK?"
- "What's the difference between V1.14.00 and V2.00.00 for camera connection?"

Your AI assistant can use the `set_sdk_version` tool to switch versions during the conversation if needed.

### When AI SDK Assistant Searches Automatically

Your AI assistant will automatically use AI SDK Assistant when you ask questions about:

- Camera Remote SDK features and capabilities
- How to implement specific SDK operations
- API function usage and parameters
- Debugging errors or understanding warnings
- Camera compatibility and requirements
- SDK code examples and patterns

<Warning>
  **For Claude Code users**: Unlike Claude web, Claude Code does not support granular tool permissions. All AI SDK Assistant tools are available once the MCP server is added. The only control is the initial approval when using project-scoped servers.
</Warning>

    > - Camera must be connected in RemoteControlMode
    > - Check `CrDeviceProperty_LiveViewStatus` is supported
    > - Camera may not accept operations immediately after connection‚Äîwait for `OnConnected()` callback
    >
    > **Workflow:**
    >
    > ```
    > 1. Enable Live View:
    >    SetDeviceProperty(CrDeviceProperty_LiveView_Enable, CrLiveView_Enable)
    > 
    > 2. Configure Live View Quality (optional):
    >    SetDeviceProperty(CrDeviceProperty_LiveView_Image_Quality, quality_setting)
    > 
    > 3. Start Image Retrieval Loop:
    >    while (streaming) {
    >        GetLiveViewImage() // Returns JPEG image data
    >        Display image on screen
    >        Process at 30fps or camera's native rate
    >    }
    > 
    > 4. Cleanup:
    >    SetDeviceProperty(CrDeviceProperty_LiveView_Enable, CrLiveView_Disable)
    > ```
    >
    > **Important Notes:**
    >
    > - Network traffic affects stability; avoid simultaneous heavy operations
    > - Image data is retrieved from internal buffer updated by background task
    > - Camera Remote SDK does not support "Enlarge Screen" mode‚Äîdisable it on camera

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multi-Camera Setup" icon="users">
    **Prompt:**

    ```
    I need to control multiple cameras simultaneously from one host PC.
    
    What are the limitations, and how should I structure my application
    to handle multiple camera connections?
    ```

    **What AI SDK Assistant Returns:**

    - Multi-camera connection limits and constraints
    - Architecture patterns for multi-camera control
    - Device handle management strategies
    - Callback handling for multiple cameras

    **Example Response Snippet:**

    >
    > - **Per Camera**: Maximum 5 simultaneous connections from different hosts/applications
    > - **Per Host PC**: No SDK-imposed limit on number of cameras (limited by system resources)
    > - **Connection Completion**: Connection isn't complete until `OnConnected()` callback is received
    > - **Exceeded Limit**: `Connect()` fails with error if camera already has 5 connections
    >
    > **Recommended Architecture:**
    >
    > ```cpp
    > // 1. Single SDK instance manages all cameras
    > Init(); // Call once for entire application
    > 
    > // 2. Enumerate all connected cameras
    > ICrEnumCameraObjectInfo* cameraList;
    > EnumCameraObjects(&cameraList);
    > 
    > // 3. Store device handles in a collection
    > std::vector<CrDeviceHandle> cameras;
    > for (int i = 0; i < cameraCount; i++) {
    >     CrDeviceHandle handle;
    >     Connect(cameraInfo[i], callback, &handle, mode);
    >     cameras.push_back(handle);
    > }
    > 
    > // 4. Manage each camera independently
    > for (auto handle : cameras) {
    >     GetDeviceProperties(handle, ...);
    >     SendCommand(handle, ...);
    > }
    > ```
    >
    > **Best Practices:**
    >
    > - Use separate callback objects or camera identifiers to distinguish events from different cameras
    > - Implement thread-safe queue for handling callbacks from multiple cameras
    > - Consider network bandwidth when using multiple cameras over LAN
    > - For time-synchronized capture, account for network latency variations
    > - Properly clean up each device handle with `Disconnect()` before `Release()`

    >    SDK::GetDeviceProperties(deviceHandle, &prop_list, &nprop);
    >    ```
    > 2. **`Check CrPropertyEnableFlag for each property:`**
    >    - Property exists in the returned list ‚Üí Feature is supported
    >    - Property not in list ‚Üí Feature not available on this camera
    > 3. **`Validate writability with IsSetEnableCurrentValue():`**
    >
    >    ```cpp
    >    if (prop.IsSetEnableCurrentValue()) {
    >        // Property is writable - you can set values
    >    } else {
    >        // Property is read-only or not currently settable
    >    }
    >    ```
    > 4. **Example validation pattern from SDK:**
    >
    >    ```cpp
    >    if (m_prop.f_number.writable == -1) {
    >        tout << "F-stop control is not supported on this camera\n";
    >        return false;
    >    }
    >    // Property is supported - safe to use
    >    ```
    >
    > **Important Notes:**
    >
    > - Some properties may be read-only in certain camera modes (e.g., Auto mode)
    > - Property availability can change based on camera settings (mode dial position, lens attached)
    > - Always validate before attempting to set values to avoid SDK errors

## Advanced Tips

### Combining Multiple Questions

For complex workflows, you can combine multiple aspects in a single prompt:

```
I'm implementing a timelapse capture system for the ILX-LR1:

1. Design: What connection mode and APIs should I use?
2. Execution: Show me C++ code to capture every 2 seconds
3. Validation: How do I test that this will run reliably for 8 hours?

Please provide a comprehensive answer covering all three areas.
```

### Learning from Examples

Ask the AI SDK Assistant to show you how the official sample apps implement features:

```
How does the official SDK sample application implement [feature]?
Show me the relevant code and explain the approach.
```

### Understanding API Relationships

Ask about how different APIs work together:

```
What's the relationship between SetSaveInfo, SendCommand for capture,
and the callback notifications? Walk me through the complete flow.
```

### What the System Prompt Provides

The system prompt configures your AI assistant to:

- **Always use MCP tools** instead of web search for SDK queries
- **Confirm SDK version and language** before answering questions
- **Generate real, compilable code** with proper citations and error handling
- **Handle C# developers** by automatically searching for C# code examples
- **Follow troubleshooting workflows** for systematic error resolution
- **Provide accurate compatibility information** with proper disclaimers

<Tip>
  Using the system prompt significantly improves response quality, especially for complex SDK workflows, debugging, and multi-step implementations.
