## Overview

Sony's AI SDK Assistant works with any AI platform that supports MCP (Model Context Protocol). Your choice of platform affects how you manage tool permissions, configure the connection, and interact with the SDK documentation.

All platforms provide access to the same underlying AI SDK Assistant capabilities—the difference is in the user experience and control options.

## Platform Comparison

| Platform                        | Account Required                   | Context Window | Tool Permissions                                                   | Code Generation                                           | Security                                        | Best For                         |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Claude (Web/Mobile/Desktop)** | Pro, Max, or Enterprise (\$20+/mo) | 200K tokens    | ✅ Granular UI controls<br />Per-tool "ask" vs "unsupervised"       | Excellent, access to your codebase for context.           | Cloud-based<br />Data retained per policy       | Most users, maximum control      |

## Detailed Platform Reviews

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Claude (Web, Mobile, Desktop) - Recommended" icon="star">
    **Best for**: Most users who want maximum control and the best MCP experience

    ### Why We Recommend Claude

    - **Granular Tool Control**: Enable/disable individual tools through an intuitive UI
    - **Permission Levels**: Set each tool to "always ask" or "allow unsupervised"
    - **Multi-Platform**: Works on web, iOS/Android mobile apps, and desktop
    - **Best MCP Support**: Built by Anthropic (creators of MCP protocol)

    ### Account Requirements

    - Claude Pro (\$20/month), Max, or Enterprise account
    - Standard free Claude accounts do not support MCP connectors

    ### Key Features

    - ✅ Visual tool configuration interface
    - ✅ Per-chat connector toggling
    - ✅ Easy connector management (add/remove/configure)
    - ✅ Can disable specific tools you don't want Claude to use

    ### Context Window & Performance

    - **200K token context window**: Handles extensive SDK documentation and long conversations
    - Sufficient for complex multi-step SDK queries with full code examples
    - Context retained across conversation for follow-up questions

    ### Tool Permission Options

    1. **Always ask for permission**: Claude prompts before using each tool
    2. **Allow unsupervised**: Claude uses tools automatically without asking

    <Tip>
      For AI SDK Assistant, we recommend starting with "allow unsupervised" for all tools to enable seamless SDK searches. You can adjust permissions later based on your preferences.
    </Tip>
    ### Security & Privacy

    - **Cloud-based processing**: Queries and responses processed on Anthropic servers
    - **Data retention**: Subject to Anthropic's privacy policy and your account type
    - **Enterprise options**: Enhanced security and compliance features available
    - **MCP connections**: Server URL and tool usage logged per Anthropic's policies

    <Note>
      Review [Anthropic's Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy) for detailed information about data handling.
    </Note>
    ### Getting Started

    See the [Setup Guide → Claude tab](/MCP-Server/setup) for detailed configuration instructions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Claude Code (CLI) - Recommended for Developers" icon="terminal">
    **Best for**: Developers, automation workflows, and CLI enthusiasts

    ### Why Use Claude Code

    - **Claude Add-on**: Included if you have a paid Claude account.
    - **Granular Permissions**: Configure tool access via settings files
    - **Automation-Friendly**: Scriptable and integrates with development workflows
    - **Multiple Scopes**: User, project, or local MCP server configurations

    ### Account Requirements

    - Paid Claude account
    - Claude Code CLI installed

    ### Tool Permission System

    Claude Code supports **granular tool-level permissions** configured through settings files:

    **Approve all tools from a server:**

    ```json
    "approvedTools": ["mcp__CRSDK"]
    ```

    **Approve specific tools only:**

    ```json
    "approvedTools": [
      "mcp__CRSDK__search_sdk",
      "mcp__CRSDK__search_code_examples",
      "mcp__CRSDK__search_documentation"
    ]
    ```

    <Note>
      - Wildcards (`*`) are **not supported** for MCP permissions
      - You must explicitly list each tool or approve the entire server
      - See [Claude Code IAM Documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/iam#access-control-and-permissions) for details
    </Note>
    ### Configuration Scopes

    - **User scope**: Global across all projects (`~/.claude.json`)
    - **Project scope**: Per-project configuration (`.claude/config.json`)
    - **Local scope**: Repository-specific (`.claude.local.json`)

    ### Context Window & Performance

    - **200K token context window**: Same as Claude web/mobile/desktop
    - Handles large SDK documentation queries and extended conversations
    - Ideal for in-depth code exploration and debugging sessions

    ### Key Differences from Claude Web

    - ❌ No visual UI for tool management
    - ✅ More flexible configuration (file-based)
    - ✅ Version control friendly (commit configs to git)
    - ✅ Automation and scripting support

    ### Security & Privacy Considerations

    - **Local configuration files**: MCP server configs stored locally on your machine
    - **Cloud processing**: Queries still processed on Anthropic servers (same as Claude web)
    - **No additional data retention**: Configuration files stay local
    - **Version control**: Can commit MCP configs to private repos (review before committing server URLs)

    <Note>
      **Code Execution Capability**: Claude Code can execute code and commands on your local machine when you grant permissions. Be mindful of what information you share in conversations, as Claude Code has broader system access than web-based Claude. Review tool permissions carefully and only approve actions you're comfortable with.
    </Note>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="ChatGPT - Alternative Option" icon="message">
    **Best for**: Users with existing ChatGPT subscriptions looking for an alternative

    <Warning>
      We currenlty do not recommend ChatGPT for use with the AI SDK Assistant due to differences in the MCP requirements for OpenAI, resulting in poor code-generation capabilities.
    </Warning>
    ### Why Use ChatGPT

    - Works if you already have a ChatGPT subscription
    - Familiar interface for ChatGPT users
    - Alternative to Claude platforms

    ### Account Requirements

    - ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Business, or EDU account
    - Free ChatGPT accounts do not support custom MCP connectors

    ### Important Limitations

    <Warning>
      - **Poor Code Generation**: Does not reliably produce actual SDK code examples (psuedo-code only)
      - **No ChatGPT Projects support**: Must use standalone chats
      - **No Deep Research mode**: MCP servers don't work with Deep Research
      - **Developer mode required**: Must enable Developer mode in settings
      - **Basic tool control**: All tools enabled or disabled together (no granular control)
    </Warning>
    ### Setup Requirements

    1. Enable **Developer mode** in ChatGPT settings
    2. Add AI SDK Assistant as a custom connector
    3. Create a **new standalone chat** (not in a Project)
    4. Enable Developer mode chip in the chat
    5. Toggle on the AI SDK Assistant connector

    ### Context Window & Performance

    - **128K token context window**: Smaller than Claude's 200K tokens
    - Still sufficient for most SDK queries and documentation searches
    - May need to break very long conversations into multiple chats

    ### Key Differences from Claude

    - ⚠️ More setup steps required
    - ⚠️ Poor code generation capabilities for SDK examples
    - ⚠️ Cannot use in Projects or Deep Research
    - ⚠️ Less flexible tool permissions
    - ⚠️ Smaller context window (128K vs 200K)
    - ✅ Works if you prefer ChatGPT's interface

    ### Security & Privacy

    - **Cloud-based processing**: Queries processed on OpenAI servers
    - **Data retention**: Varies by account type (Plus, Pro, Business, EDU)
    - **Business/EDU accounts**: Enhanced privacy and data controls available
    - **MCP connections**: Developer mode connections subject to OpenAI's policies

    <Note>
      Review [OpenAI's Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy) for details on data handling and retention policies.
