## Overview

AI SDK Assistant works with any AI platform that supports MCP (Model Context Protocol). Your choice of platform affects how you manage tool permissions, configure the connection, and interact with the SDK documentation.

All platforms provide access to the same underlying AI SDK Assistant capabilities—the difference is in the user experience and control options.

## Detailed Platform Reviews

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Claude (Web, Mobile, Desktop) - Recommended" icon="star">
    **Best for**: Most users who want maximum control and the best MCP experience

    ### Why We Recommend Claude

    - **Granular Tool Control**: Enable/disable individual tools through an intuitive UI
    - **Permission Levels**: Set each tool to "always ask" or "allow unsupervised"
    - **Multi-Platform**: Works on web, iOS/Android mobile apps, and desktop
    - **Best MCP Support**: Built by Anthropic (creators of MCP protocol)

    ### Account Requirements

    - Claude Pro ($20/month), Max, or Enterprise account
    - Standard free Claude accounts do not support MCP connectors

    ### Key Features

    - ✅ Visual tool configuration interface
    - ✅ Per-chat connector toggling
    - ✅ Easy connector management (add/remove/configure)
    - ✅ Can disable specific tools you don't want Claude to use

    ### Tool Permission Options

    1. **Always ask for permission**: Claude prompts before using each tool
    2. **Allow unsupervised**: Claude uses tools automatically without asking

    <Tip>
      For AI SDK Assistant, we recommend starting with "allow unsupervised" for all tools to enable seamless SDK searches. You can adjust permissions later based on your preferences.
    </Tip>

    ### Getting Started

    See the [Setup Guide → Claude tab](/MCP-Server/setup) for detailed configuration instructions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Claude Code (CLI) - Recommended for Developers" icon="terminal">
    **Best for**: Developers, automation workflows, and CLI enthusiasts

    ### Why Use Claude Code

    - **Free**: No subscription required (works with standard Claude account)
    - **Granular Permissions**: Configure tool access via settings files
    - **Automation-Friendly**: Scriptable and integrates with development workflows
    - **Multiple Scopes**: User, project, or local MCP server configurations

    ### Account Requirements

    - Standard Claude account (free)
    - Claude Code CLI installed

    ### Tool Permission System

    Claude Code supports **granular tool-level permissions** configured through settings files:

    **Approve all tools from a server:**
    ```json
    "approvedTools": ["mcp__Kando"]
    ```

    **Approve specific tools only:**
    ```json
    "approvedTools": [
      "mcp__Kando__search_sdk",
      "mcp__Kando__search_code_examples",
      "mcp__Kando__search_documentation"
    ]
    ```

    <Note>
      - Wildcards (`*`) are **not supported** for MCP permissions
      - You must explicitly list each tool or approve the entire server
      - See [Claude Code IAM Documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/iam#access-control-and-permissions) for details
    </Note>

    ### Configuration Scopes

    - **User scope**: Global across all projects (`~/.claude.json`)
    - **Project scope**: Per-project configuration (`.claude/config.json`)
    - **Local scope**: Repository-specific (`.claude.local.json`)

    ### Key Differences from Claude Web

    - ❌ No visual UI for tool management
    - ✅ More flexible configuration (file-based)
    - ✅ Version control friendly (commit configs to git)
    - ✅ Automation and scripting support

    ### Getting Started

    See the [Setup Guide → Claude Code tab](/MCP-Server/setup) for configuration commands and examples.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="ChatGPT - Alternative Option" icon="message">
    **Best for**: Users with existing ChatGPT subscriptions looking for an alternative

    ### Why Use ChatGPT

      - **Developer mode required**: Must enable Developer mode in settings
      - **Basic tool control**: All tools enabled or disabled together (no granular control)
    </Warning>

    ### Setup Requirements
