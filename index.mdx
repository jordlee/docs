## Getting Started

<Warning>
  **ChatGPT Not Recommended**: Due to OpenAI's unofficial support for MCP servers, ChatGPT has poor code generation and limited functionality with AI SDK Assistant. We strongly recommend using Claude for SDK development. Only use ChatGPT if you already have an active subscription.
