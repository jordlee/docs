ChatGPT

With ChatGPT, use the connector mainly to explain high level concepts, API specs, compatiblity. Code generation is limited with ChatGPT; code generated from ChatGPT is mostly pseudo-code at this stage. 

If you are looking for a particular type of information, for example, API compatibility or code examples, include these categories in your query. Due to ChatGPTs tool usage interface (how LLMs access external resources), you cannot use the granular search methods available through the AI tool. Because of this, I recommend disabling all tools except for “search” and “fetch” tools to avoid confusing ChatGPT, as it cannot utilize these other search filters.\

Recommendation:

Don’t use ChatGPT for SDK development/research unless you already have a paid subscription or your organizaiton does not authorize using Claude. It has inferior code-generation, documentation search, and debugging capabilities compared to Anthropic’s (Claude) models.

Strengths

Weaknesses

Well-established models

Tool usage (ability to use external resources, websites, data) is poor compared to Claude

 

Limited search filtering for documentation and sample code

 

Poor code generation (pseudo-code only)

 

More complicated setup and maintinence process

 

Only supported in developer mode; no deep research or projects

 

Cannot use multiple connectors at once (i.e. SDK, web search, etc.)

Claude  (Web, Mobile)

With the Claude.ai web app or mobile app, you can harness the power of Anthropic’s models best-in-class code-generation and analysis to plan and execute your CrSDK integration end-to-end. 

We recommend using this version of Claude particularly when exploring and planning out your integration with the SDK. The simple web UI makes it easy for both technical and non-technical stakeholders to understand the SDK at a high level and make a plan for how to leverage its capbitilies.

While the code-generation capabilty of the web and mobile versions of Claude are on par with that of Claude Code (assuming the same model is used), we recommend using Claude Code for actual code implementation in your codebase. Claude Code runs in your terminal, meaning you can give it selective access to files to read and write (based on permissions you set), and it can understand your code and best wasy to integrate the SDK. When given access to the AI SDK Assistant and core SDK files, like headers, callback interface, and build scripts, Claude Code can genereate much more functional code and debugging that will integrate better in an production environment. 

If your organizaiton does not allow Claude Code or terminal based agents, then we recommned you stick to the web/mobile version of claude, which do not have direct access to your codebase. 

One limitation of the Claude web/mbile vs Claude Code is the context window: a LLM’s context window is the maximum length of the conversation it can hold before its memory of the conversation becomes full. 

The AI SDK Assistant is designed to search information as efficiently as possible to reduce the amount of tokens (unit of measurement for context length) required to gather relevant SDK information. However, due to the shorter Context window of Claude Web/mobile, larger requests (such as cmoplex workflows, in-depth code generation and debugging) may limit the amount of questions/information you can gather in a single chat session. 

In these cases, we recommend using Claude Code for longer sessions and continuous problem solving.

Claude Code

Claude Code shares the same LLM models as Claude Web/Mobile, but leverages the agentic capabilities of running in the command line and ability to execute tasks autonamoulsy (with your permission). This allows Claude to read code, write code, build and execute scripts, and search acorss files you allow access to. 

Claude Code excels at understanding context across multiple files; this makes it perfect for executing a plan created in Claude web/mobile to integrate APIs into your existing code base, as it understands how relevant parts will integrate. 

When using Claude Code with the AI SDK Assistant, we recommend you add the following to your project directory from the ofifical SDK download: header files (C++) located in /app and /crsdk folders, drivers located in the /driver folder, build scripts, located in the /cmake folder, external dependencies and pre-compiled libraries located in teh /external folder. While the AI SDK Assistant has access to these files already, including them directly in your repositiory will help speed up integration by providing direct access to full header declarations.
